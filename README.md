# eng-to-nep-translation

This project fine tunes the pre-trained model [facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M](https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M) using the english to nepali translation dataset [CohleM/english-to-nepali](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohleM/english-to-nepali).

## How to replicate?

- Use the eng-to-nep.ipynb file to train(fine-tune) the model in Kaggle
- Run the web_app.ipynb file in either Colab(tested) or Kaggle or locally to run web-app for translation
